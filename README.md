## How To Play

Bloomin Bouquets is similar to a word search, but instead of only being able to move up, down, left, right, and diagonal, you can spread out in all directions. After a tile is selected, that letter will appaer above. You can then select _any_ of the times that are adjacent to _any_ of the tiles you have selected previously. Plan and strategize to form the longest word you can, or relax by creating many beautiful small words.

## Sending Bouquets

Each word corresponds to a flower. You can send flowers via text or in app.
